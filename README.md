# Sign Language Detection using Deep Learning

This project is aimed at bridging communication gaps for individuals with speech or hearing impairments by using a deep learning model to recognize gestures in real time. It specifically focuses on detecting Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures and translating them into text to facilitate better interaction for individuals unfamiliar with sign language.

## Project Overview
This deep learning-based model utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and recognize words from a personâ€™s hand gestures in ISL. The model achieves around 97% accuracy in recognizing 11 different ISL gestures, leveraging feedback-based learning from video frames. This system is designed to reduce communication barriers and assist those who are speech or hearing impaired.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project, utilized for its flexibility in machine learning and computer vision tasks.
- **TensorFlow**: A deep learning library used for building and training the LSTM, GRU, and CNN models.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for real-time hand detection and tracking.
- **OpenCV**: A library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDE used for project development.

## System Architecture
The project is organized into modules that perform:
1. **Hand Detection**: Using MediaPipe, captures and tracks hand gestures in real time.
2. **Feature Extraction**: CNNs process the video frames and extract features.
3. **Sequence Modeling**: LSTM and GRU layers process sequential data from CNN to recognize gestures.
4. **Text Conversion**: Recognized gestures are converted into meaningful text output.

### Data Flow
The data flow includes inputting video frames, extracting and preprocessing frames, model processing for classification, and generating textual output.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the custom IISL2020 dataset. Preprocessing includes augmentation (rotations, scaling) to ensure robust performance across various conditions.

## Model
The model utilizes a hybrid architecture with:
- **CNN**: For feature extraction from individual video frames.
- **LSTM and GRU**: Sequential models used to capture temporal patterns in gestures.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Language-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sign-Language-Detection
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. To run the model on a live video feed:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Adjust settings in the configuration file to select the preferred output language or set custom parameters for real-time processing.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 97% on 24 symbols representing the English alphabet. Comparative model performance:
- **ResNet-50**: 99.99% accuracy
- **EfficientNet, AlexNet**: Over 99% accuracy
- **Vision Transformer**: 88.59% accuracy

## Future Work
Plans for enhancing the project include:
- Expanding the dataset to include dynamic characters and facial expressions.
- Improving the model to handle multilingual sign languages and real-time lighting conditions.
- Integrating two-way communication and voice output.
